## Why Levenshtein distance and not Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance  
Levenshtein computes the distance between two words taking three possible ways into account, insertions, deletions or substitutions, of single characters.  
Damerau-Levenshtein distance on the other hand considers mispelling that could be corrected with at most one edit operation taking into account insertions, deletions or substitutions and it considers transposition (of two adjacent characters, as a possible step) which is not needed in this scenerio.
